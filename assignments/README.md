# Assignments

- Assignment 1 (Deal cards) - Using the this [API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) that simulates dealing a deck of cards, write a program that "deals" (prints out) 5 cards. Firstly you need to shuffle the deck. Using `deals.py`, the dealt cards and deck id was saved to `five_dealt_cards.txt`. An updated python program `deals2.py` that checks if the user has drawn a pair (two cards of the same value), triple (three cards of the same value), straight (five consecutive values), or all of the same suit (flushes) and congratulate the user with cards dealt saved within `dealt_cards.txt`. `deals2.py` also adds extra functions to check the five cards.

- Assignment 4 (Github) - Write a program in python (`assignment04-github.py`) that will read a file from a repository (in this example, `sample_text.txt` was used). The program should then replace all the instances of the text "Andrew" with your name (Ellen).
