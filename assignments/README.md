- Assignment 1 (Deal cards) - Using the this [API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) that simulates dealing a deck of cards, write a program that "deals" (prints out) 5 cards. Firstly you need to shuffle the deck. Using `deals.py`, the dealt cards and deck id was saved to `five_dealt_cards.txt`. An updated python program `deals2.py` that checks if the user has drawn a pair, triple, straight, flush, or all of the same suit and congratulate the user with cards dealt saved within `dealt_cards.txt`.
